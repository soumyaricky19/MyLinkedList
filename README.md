# MyLinkedList

Implement various features of a linked list In this project you will add methods to an existing linked list class and make a stack to solve the balanced symbol problem.

Part 1

Implement "MyLinkedList" class and the following methods:

a. swap receives two index positions as parameters, and swaps the nodes at these positions by changing the links, provided both positions are within the current size

b. shift receives an integer (positive or negative) and shifts the list this many positions forward (if positive) or backward (if negative).
1,2,3,4 shifted +2 3,4,1,2 1,2,3,4 shifted -1 4,1,2,3

c. erase receives an index position and number of elements as parameters, and removes elements beginning at the index position for the number of elements specified, provided the index position is within the size and together with the number of elements does not exceed the size

d. insertList receives another MyLinkedList and an index position as parameters, and copies the list from the passed list into the list at the specified position, provided the index position does not exceed the size.

e. main add code to the main method to demonstrate each of your methods

Part 2

Create a MyStack class that uses an ArrayList to make a stack.
